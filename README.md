# lablogger_swiss

This repository hosts the code used to automate the SWISS units in summer 2022. A full list of parts, and a wiring diagram can be found in the supplement of Havranek et al., 2023 (HESS). 

All components are defined in the file "src/swiss/swiss.cpp" Additionally, in this file is where the steps and timing of each step are defined. 

The setup of each component of the system can be found in the folder "src/modules". Each module has a *.cpp and *.h file - any necessary edits will likely be made in the *.h file
